# Inter-OS Migration Of CAD Tools For IC Design

By [M. B. Ghaznavi-Ghoushchi](https://github.com/ghoushchi).

This is a presentation from 2001 on mostly-open-source tools and related languages with Inter-OS migration in mind. No bit is changed in the original 2001 draft but my recent email. 

It is a glimpse of time from 2001 on status of tools and languages that are now in front-line of 
Free Open-Source Software (FOSS) Movement from Inter-OS migration viewpoints. 
Looking back shows how the open-source tools are matured during the years.
A presention from my student days in TMU/IEEE students branch.
Thanks to TMU EECS department for supporting me during that fantastic days!
